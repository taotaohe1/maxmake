- First move the X-axis to the left side, take out the grease from the accessory box, and apply evenly and appropriately to the guide rails and lead screw
- Move the X-axis to the far right, continue applying appropriate amount of grease
- Move the X-axis back to the far left

## 4. Y-axis Maintenance

Y-axis maintenance requires laying the equipment on its side. Before laying on side, first control the Y-axis to move to the middle position, then power off and lay on side.

Apply grease evenly to the guide rails and lead screw.

After returning the equipment to upright position, power on and operate normally.
