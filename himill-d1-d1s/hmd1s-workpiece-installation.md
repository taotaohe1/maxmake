## 1. Correct Method for Clamping Plate Installation

When using clamping plates, keep the clamping plates parallel and press down on the workpiece. The diagram shows the correct installation method.

> 📋 **Installation Key Points**:
> 
> - Ensure clamping plates are parallel to workpiece surface
> - Apply uniform pressure to avoid workpiece displacement
> - Clamping plate positions should avoid machining areas

## 2. Screw Length Selection

Choose screws of appropriate length. After fixing, they should not contact the bottom panel. This prevents scratching the bottom panel when the platform moves.
The diagram below shows incorrect installation

> 🔧 **Screw Selection Principles**:
> 
> - Screw length should be moderate, not touching the workbench bottom
> - Ensure sufficient clamping force to fix the workpiece
> - Avoid overly long screws affecting spindle movement

## 3. Large Object Clamping Method

When clamping large objects, ensure the edges are firmly clamped. If clamping plates cannot clamp correctly, please change to other fixing methods.

> ⚙️ **Large Object Clamping Strategy**:
> 
> - Prioritize fixing the workpiece edge areas
> - Consider using multiple clamping plates to distribute clamping force
> - Choose appropriate fixing methods based on workpiece shape
>

## 4. Machining Range Awareness

Before clamping, you should be familiar with the machining range, which is the length, width, and height of the machining tool path. Clamping plates should avoid all tool paths to prevent tools from hitting clamping plates during machining.

> 📐 **Machining Range Planning**:
> 
> - Confirm workpiece machining path is obstacle-free
> - Clamping plate positions should completely avoid tool trajectories
> - Reserve sufficient safety clearance

## 5. Wooden Substrate Removal and Installation

Wooden substrate removal and installation are as shown below. Use a wrench to tighten or loosen the corresponding countersunk screws.

> ⚠️ **Substrate Clamping Precautions**:
> 
> - Ensure screws are below the wood board surface
> - If there are cutting tool paths, also avoid screw positions to prevent cutting into screws and causing tool breakage

> 🛠️ **Support Bar Usage Guide**:
> 
> - Ensure support bar installation is firm and stable
> - Adjust support bar position according to workpiece size
> - Support bar surface should be clean and flat
