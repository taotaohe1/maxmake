If you receive a Maxmake product package and find any damage, please follow the process below to ensure you receive timely and effective compensation.

## 1. Contact Us Immediately
If there is any damage within 4 working days after signing for the package, you must contact us immediately via Discord or email so we can file a claim with the shipping company.

## 2. Preserve the Scene
Until the claim is settled, you must keep the outer box and all packaging materials. Do not discard them or attempt repairs yourself.

## 3. Complete Documentation
Please ensure you provide all the following evidence materials. Each one is essential:

### 1. Outer Box with Shipping Label
The shipping label must be clearly visible.
