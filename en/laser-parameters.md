## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Please carefully read the laser usage instructions and follow safety precautions before use**：
   - [Laser Module Usage Instructions](/en/himill-d1-d1s/hmd1s-laser-module.md)

2. **Processing mirrored metal is not recommended**：May cause laser reflection and damage the laser module

3. **This laser is a blue laser**：Cannot process transparent materials

4. **Parameter adjustment suggestion**：Adjust speed and power reasonably based on actual results

## 📊 Engraving Parameters Recommendation

| Material | Recommended Parameters |
|----------|------------------------|
| Wood Board | 25~35%+2000mm/min |
| Solid Wood | 20~30%+2000mm/min |
| Non-transparent Plastic | 20~30%+2000mm/min |
| Paper | 5~10%+2000mm/min |
| Rock Plate | 25~35%+2000mm/min |
| Leather | 8~15%+2000mm/min |

> 💡 **Tip**：Different brands and batches of materials may vary, so it's recommended to test parameters on scrap materials before formal processing.

## 📏 Cutting Parameters Recommendation

| Material | Recommended Parameters |
|----------|------------------------|
| 3mm Basswood Board | 100%+250mm/min |
| 3mm Black Acrylic | 100%+150mm/min |
| 3mm MDF Board | 100%+180mm/min |
| Cardstock | 40%+1200mm/min |
| Kraft Paper | 50%+1200mm/min |

> ⚠️ **Note**：When cutting thick materials, it's recommended to conduct multiple tests to determine the optimal parameters, ensuring cutting quality and equipment safety.

## 📝 Parameter Explanation

- **Parameter Format**：Power percentage + processing speed (e.g., 25~35%+2000mm/min)
- **Power Range**：0-100%, adjust appropriately based on material thickness and desired processing effect
- **Maximum Speed**：Maximum processing speed in laser mode is 2000mm/min (approximately 33mm/s)
- **Focus Adjustment**：The optimal focal position for laser processing is 5mm from the bottom of the light shield to the material surface

## 🔒 Safety Usage Guide

1. **Correct Installation**：Please install the laser correctly according to the instructions before operating it
2. **Supervision Required**：Ensure someone is near the machine during laser processing
3. **Prohibited Materials**：Flammable and explosive objects, PVC and other chlorine-containing materials, polycarbonate, fiberglass, carbon fiber, uncoated metals, etc.
4. **Material Limitations**：Do not stack cutting materials (e.g., cutting two or more sheets at once)
5. **Regular Cleaning**：Regularly clean processing debris to prevent combustion caused by residual debris
6. **High Temperature Protection**：The laser generates high temperatures during operation, do not touch to avoid burns
7. **Eye Protection**：Do not observe the laser spot with naked eyes for a long time, wear protective glasses during operation
