# 📡 MaxmakeLab HiMill D1/D1S Network Configuration

## 🌟 Feature Introduction

The HiMill device is equipped with a built-in WiFi module that supports wireless control functionality. After configuring the network and connecting to the device, you can achieve the same operation experience as using a data cable connection when the network is stable. Below are detailed instructions for the two WiFi connection methods:

## 🏠 Local Network Connection

Local network connection allows the HiMill device to connect directly to your home or office router, enabling computers on the same local network to access the device (the computer must also be connected to the same router).

### Step 1: Connect Device via USB and Complete Reset

1. Launch the MaxmakeLab software
2. Connect the device to your computer using a USB cable
3. Wait for the device to complete automatic reset, and ensure the device status is normal before proceeding to the next step

### Step 2: Select STA Mode and Configure WiFi Parameters

1. Click the "Device Settings" button in the software interface
2. Select "STA Mode" in the settings interface
3. Enter your router's WiFi name (SSID) and password

> ⚠️ **Important Notice**：
> - Please ensure the WiFi name and password are entered correctly, as this process will directly write the configuration information to the device's WiFi module. Incorrect input will result in connection failure

### Step 3: Click Config Button to Configure

1. Click the "Config" button to start the configuration process
2. The software will transfer the configuration information to the device item by item, please wait patiently for the configuration to complete
3. After successful configuration, the software will display a "Restarting network module" prompt

### Step 4: View Device IP Address

1. After waiting 15-30 seconds, reopen the "Device Settings" interface
2. If the device successfully connected to the router, the interface will display the IP address obtained by the device
3. Record this IP address, as it will be needed for subsequent connections
4. Close the software and power off the device to complete the network configuration process

> ⚠️ **Important Notice**：
> - Please unplug the USB cable before restarting the device
> - Keep the USB cable disconnected during wireless control

4. Enter the device IP address you recorded earlier in the "Device IP" input box
5. Click the "Connect" button, and a connection success prompt will appear after successful connection

> ⚠️ **Connection Tips**：
> - If the first connection attempt fails, disconnect and try again
> - After successful connection, it is recommended to enter the "workflow" interface and perform a "homing" operation to confirm the device responds normally
