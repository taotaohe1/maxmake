## 4. Vacuum Cleaner Selection and Use

Household vacuum cleaners can be used, with recommended power of 1000W or higher. Ensure the vacuum cleaner can operate stably for extended periods to prevent safety accidents caused by overheating.

> 📋 **Usage Recommendations**:
> 
> - Tool extension length should be flush with the bottom of the dust hood brush
> - Dust collection system is recommended for processing wood, machined wax, and other light debris materials
> - If wood chips are too long and may cause duct blockage, please clear the blockage promptly after the equipment stops processing
> - When processing metal materials such as aluminum and brass, the dust hood is not recommended. This may cause metal debris accumulation, leading to reprocessing debris and ultimately tool breakage due to overheating
