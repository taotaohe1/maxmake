## Internal Button and Indicator Issues

### Possible Phenomena
- Multi-color LED bead does not light up (no color is displayed)
- Multi-color LED bead displays only some colors
- Buttons do not trigger

### Possible Causes
- Damaged or faulty LED bead
- Poor line contact or disconnected wires
- Mechanical button failure
- Control board failure

### Solutions
1. Confirm the device is properly connected to power and check if the power switch is working normally
2. Check if the device is operating normally. Internal and external indicators and buttons share the same trigger signal. If the external indicators and buttons work normally, the main control system is functioning properly.
3. Check if the connections on the main control board are loose or have poor contact (at the factory, all connections on the internal indicator circuit board are wrapped with glue, so they should not come loose in theory and do not need to be checked).
