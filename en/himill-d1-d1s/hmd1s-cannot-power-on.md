# HiMill D1/D1S Cannot Power On

---

### Possible Phenomena
- No response from the device after connecting to power
- Device lights, indicators, and spindle lights are all off
- No response when pressing the power switch
- Smoke coming from the back of the device after connecting to power

### Possible Causes
- Damaged or disconnected power cord
- Faulty power socket or no power supply
- Fault in the internal power module
- Incorrect voltage adjustment that doesn't match the input voltage, e.g., external power supply is 220V but the power module is adjusted to 110V

### Solutions
1. Check if the power cord is obviously damaged or disconnected
2. Replace the power socket and confirm if the socket has normal power supply. Under normal power supply, the internal power indicator should light up. For cover removal steps, refer to the video for replacing the main control board [HiMill D1/D1S Air Cabinet Component Replacement](/en/himill-d1-d1s/hmd1s-replace-air-cabinet.md)
