# HiMill D1S Cannot Connect to Software via USB Cable

---

## Cable Issues

### Possible Causes
- Damaged USB cable
- Poor USB interface contact
- Signal attenuation due to excessively long USB cable

### Solutions
1. Check if the USB cable has obvious damage or disconnection
2. Replace with a high-quality USB data cable (original equipment cable or shielded USB cable is recommended)
3. Check if the device USB interface and computer USB interface have dust or oxidation
4. Try re-plugging the USB cable to ensure a secure connection
5. Replace the USB interface (try another USB port on the computer)
6. Avoid using excessively long USB extension cables; if necessary, use an extension cable with signal amplification function
7. Check if the USB connection terminal on the main control board is loose or has poor contact; please refer to the video on replacing the main control board for steps to remove the rear cover [HiMill D1S Air Cabinet Component Replacement](/eng/himill-d1-d1s/hmd1s-replace-air-cabinet.md)

## Interference Issues

### Possible Causes
- Strong electromagnetic interference sources nearby (such as motors, transformers, wireless devices, etc.)
- USB cable laid parallel to other high-voltage lines
- Insufficient power supply from computer USB port
- Abnormal computer USB driver

### Solutions
1. Keep the device away from strong electromagnetic interference sources (such as high-power motors, microwave ovens, wireless routers, etc.)
2. Avoid laying USB cables parallel to high-voltage lines (such as power cables)
3. Try using a USB hub (with independent power supply) to provide stable power
4. Check if the device USB interface has an electromagnetic shielding cover (if applicable)
5. Update or reinstall the computer USB driver
6. Restart the computer and device, then retry the connection
7. Try connecting the device in a different environment to confirm if it is an environmental interference issue
