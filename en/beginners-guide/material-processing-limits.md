It helps beginners systematically understand which materials can be safely processed, which are strictly prohibited, and how to improve processing results through pretreatment techniques, ensuring both equipment and personal safety.

## 📊 I. Recommended Materials (Exclusive for Desktop Low-Power Laser Engravers)

The core processing advantages of desktop low-power laser engravers are engraving, marking, and fine cutting of thin non-metallic materials. Due to power limitations, they cannot currently cut thick materials or high-melting-point metals. The following categories are industry-verified, highly compatible materials that beginners can prioritize.

### 🪵 Non-Metallic Rigid Sheets

| Typical Materials | Compatible Processing Types | Key Precautions |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| • Acrylic (Plexiglass)<br>• MDF/Multiplex (knot-free)<br>• Basswood, bamboo<br>• Epoxy resin boards (bubble-free) | Surface engraving, deep engraving, thin material cutting, flat marking | • Avoid high power with low speed for acrylic to prevent burning and scorching<br>• Choose knot-free, mold-free wooden boards; knots cause uneven density and processing issues<br>• Avoid bubble areas in epoxy resin boards; bubbles reflect laser energy and damage surfaces |

## ⚠️ II. Prohibited Materials (Absolutely Forbidden, No Exceptions)

Desktop low-power laser engravers absolutely prohibit processing the following four categories of materials. The core reasons include toxic gas emissions, fire/explosion risks, permanent equipment damage, and personal injury risks. Beginners must strictly avoid these materials and never attempt to process them.

### 1. Chlorine-Containing Plastics

**Typical Materials**: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets/pipes, PVC stickers, neoprene rubber, chlorine-containing plastic films, PVC foam boards

**Core Risks**: Chlorine-containing plastics undergo thermal decomposition at laser high temperatures, releasing chlorine gas, hydrogen chloride, dioxins, and other toxic substances. Chlorine gas irritates and corrodes respiratory tract mucosa, causing cough and chest tightness with short-term exposure, and lung damage with long-term/large exposure. Dioxins are highly carcinogenic, difficult to degrade, and accumulate in equipment and processing environments, posing ongoing health risks. Additionally, hydrogen chloride corrodes metal components (like laser heads and rails), reducing equipment lifespan.

  <img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/含氯塑料.png" alt="Chlorine-Containing Plastics Example 1" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />
  <img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/含氯塑料2.png" alt="Chlorine-Containing Plastics Example 2" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />
</div>

### 2. Mirror/Highly Reflective Materials

**Typical Materials**: Mirror stainless steel sheets, electroplated metal parts, aluminum/tin foil, mirror aluminum, polished copper, glass mirrors

**Core Risks**: Lasers are high-energy light beams. Mirror/highly reflective materials have extremely high light reflectivity, causing laser beams to reflect directly back to the laser's core emission components (like laser diodes). Lasers lack anti-high-reflection protection and can be damaged or destroyed by reflected high-energy beams, resulting in permanent equipment failure (repair costs are extremely high or irreparable). Reflected laser beams also scatter unpredictably, potentially burning operators' eyes or skin.

</div>

### 3. Flammable Materials

**Typical Materials**: Foam plastic (EPS/Styrofoam), polyurethane foam, alcohol-soaked cotton/flammable liquid-soaked materials, thick stacked paper, celluloid, pyroxylin

**Core Risks**: These materials have extremely low ignition points. Laser processing temperatures directly ignite them, and foam materials produce large amounts of toxic smoke while burning rapidly, easily causing fires. In enclosed spaces, burning gas expansion may cause small explosions, resulting in equipment and personal injury.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/易燃材料.png" alt="Flammable Materials Example" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />
  <img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/易燃材料2.png" alt="Flammable Materials Example 2" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />
</div>

### 4. Unknown Composition Composite Materials

**Typical Materials**: Unbranded composite boards, plastic ornaments with unknown composition, composite foam stickers, unlabeled sandwich materials, "multifunctional craft boards" from social media

**Core Risks**: These materials lack clear composition labeling and likely contain harmful substances like chlorine-containing plastics, heavy metals, or flammable fillers. Processing releases unknown toxic gases, and thermal reactions are unpredictable, potentially causing localized fires, material cracking, or reflective component exposure. Additionally, composites have poor interlayer bonding, which can separate under heat, resulting in poor processing quality and potential equipment jamming.

## 🔬 III. Core Factors Limiting Material Processing

Material processing limitations for desktop low-power laser engravers aren't caused by a single factor but result from the interaction between laser and material physical/chemical properties. These four core factors are key determinants of whether a material can be laser processed.

### 1. Laser Absorption Rate (Wavelength Matching + Light Reflectivity)

Laser processing requires materials to absorb laser energy; unabsorbed energy is reflected or transmitted, preventing processing. This primarily depends on the match between laser wavelength and material properties, as well as the material's inherent light reflectivity.

**Desktop laser engravers primarily use infrared wavelengths for non-metals and blue/fiber wavelengths for metals**. Infrared wavelengths have extremely high absorption efficiency for non-metallic materials (wood, acrylic, leather), making them optimal for non-metal processing. Blue and fiber wavelengths absorb better in metals while maintaining some absorption in non-metals, serving as "universal wavelengths."

**Light reflectivity impact**: Matte/rough surfaces have low reflectivity and efficiently absorb laser energy; mirror/polished surfaces have high reflectivity, barely absorb laser energy, and only reflect it (see Section II: Prohibited Materials).

### 2. Thermal Effects (Melting/Decomposition Temperature Differences)

Laser processing essentially uses high temperature to achieve material vaporization, melting, or decomposition. The melting point (mainly for metals) and decomposition temperature (mainly for non-metals) of materials directly determine whether low-power lasers can achieve processing, while heat conduction speed also affects processing results.

**Low decomposition temperature materials (compatible processing)**: Wood, acrylic, leather, etc. These materials have decomposition temperatures far below desktop laser output temperatures, allowing low power to achieve rapid decomposition and vaporization, suitable for engraving/cutting.

**High melting/decomposition temperature materials (limited processing)**: Ordinary steel, aluminum, glass, etc. Desktop low-power lasers cannot reach their melting/decomposition temperatures, only achieving surface marking through pretreatment, not cutting/deep engraving.

**Fast heat conduction materials (limited processing)**: Copper, aluminum, and other metals conduct heat extremely quickly, causing laser heat to diffuse rapidly and preventing localized high temperatures. Thus, only shallow marking is possible at low power, requiring high speed parameters to reduce heat diffusion.

### 3. Toxicity Release (Thermal Decomposition of Harmful Components)

Some materials are non-toxic themselves but release toxic gases, heavy metal dust, and other harmful substances during thermal decomposition at laser high temperatures. These materials fall into the "not recommended for processing" category, primarily including:

**Halogen-containing materials**: Beyond chlorine-containing plastics, bromine-containing flame-retardant plastics, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), etc. release hydrogen bromide, fluorine gas, and other toxic gases at high temperatures, corroding respiratory tracts and equipment.

**Heavy metal-containing materials**: Colored electroplated parts, lead-containing plastics, colored fluorescent plastics, and some painted ceramics release heavy metals (lead, mercury, chromium) as dust at high temperatures. When inhaled, these accumulate in the body, causing liver/kidney damage and neurological harm.

### 4. Physical Structure (Thickness + Density Uniformity)

Desktop low-power lasers have limited energy, and laser beam energy density decreases with processing depth. Material density uniformity directly affects processing quality, representing a core hardware-level processing limitation.

**Thickness limitation**: Laser cutting thickness correlates positively with power; low-power devices can only cut thin non-metals. Higher power enables cutting thicker materials. Exceeding power-compatible thickness results in incomplete cutting and potential material burning.

**Density uniformity limitation**: Knotty wood, bubbly resin, sandwich MDF, and cracked ceramics have uneven density distribution, causing significant differences in laser energy absorption. High-density areas absorb less energy (shallow processing), while low-density areas absorb more (prone to burning), resulting in uneven surfaces, distorted patterns, or even material splattering from bubble rupture.

## 🛠️ IV. Special Material Processing Solutions (For "Processable but Poor Quality" Materials)

For materials that can be laser processed but yield poor results due to reflection, burning, or special shaping, you don't need to replace equipment. Pretreatment techniques or simple hardware upgrades can enable compatible processing. Below are desktop-level standardized solutions that beginners can easily implement.

### 1. Pretreatment Techniques (No Hardware Cost, Beginner-Friendly)

Simple physical/chemical treatments alter material surface properties, improving laser absorption, reducing thermal effects, and adapting to reflective materials, burn-prone materials, and fine processing materials.

**Coating method**: For mirror/glossy metals and glossy ceramics, evenly apply laser marking fluid, oil-based black marker, or specialized coating agent to create a low-reflection, high-absorption film. Laser processing first melts the coating, then marks the material surface. Residual coating can be easily wiped off afterward without affecting the material itself.

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/涂层法.png" alt="Coating Method Example" style="width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

**Covering method**: For burn-prone materials like acrylic and wood, apply masking tape or kraft paper to the processing surface. The laser penetrates the paper before processing the material, leaving scorch marks on the paper instead of the material. After processing, simply peel off the paper for a smooth, scorch-free surface. Covering also prevents slag adhesion.

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/覆法2.png" alt="Covering Method Example" style="width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

**Moistening method**: For heat-sensitive, fine engraving materials like paper and thin leather, spray a fine mist of water (no standing water) on the surface. Evaporating water carries away some heat, reducing the heat-affected zone, preventing material deformation, and improving fine engraving edge smoothness.

**Sanding method**: For mirror metals and glossy aluminum, sand the processing surface to a matte/sandblasted finish using fine sandpaper. This reduces light reflectivity, improves laser absorption, and is suitable for metal marking where maintaining a glossy finish isn't required.

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/打磨法.png" alt="Sanding Method Example" style="width: 45%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

### 2. Hardware Upgrade Adaptations (Low-Cost Simple Upgrades for Desktop Equipment)

For special-shaped materials, slag-prone materials, and slightly thicker materials, desktop-specific simple accessories can improve processing results without modifying core equipment components.

**Air assistance**: Install a small silent air pump + nozzle to direct compressed air at the laser head processing point. This blows away material slag during processing, preventing scorch marks from slag adhesion, while air carries away some heat, reducing the heat-affected zone. Suitable for acrylic and wood cutting.

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/空气辅助.png" alt="Air Assistance Example" style="width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

**Rotary attachment**: Install an electric rotary fixture to secure cylindrical/conical materials (mugs, pen holders, bamboo tubes, ceramic cups). The laser head moves in a plane while the rotary attachment rotates the material, enabling circular engraving/marking on cylindrical surfaces. Suitable for cultural and creative products and personalized customization.

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/material-processing-limits/旋转附件.png" alt="Rotary Attachment Example" style="width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

**Fixture upgrades**: Replace traditional manual fixtures with magnetic or vacuum adsorption fixtures to securely hold flexible materials (leather, paper) and thin materials (metal sheets), preventing material shifting during processing and improving precision.

**Power fine-tuning**: Some desktop devices support power expansion modules to slightly increase power, adapting to slightly thicker non-metal cutting. Note: Never exceed rated power upgrades, as this will damage the laser.

## 🧪 V. Material Processing Test Process Recommendations (Beginner Must-Do, Standardized Operation)

Even with the recommended materials in Part I, processing parameters vary by brand, batch, and thickness. To avoid unknown material composition risks, standardized testing is essential before processing any new material. This desktop-level laser processing test process effectively prevents finished product scrapping and safety accidents.

### 1. Small Sample Testing (Core Step, Verifying Processing Results)

Take a small sample of the same material, thickness, and surface treatment as the final product. Perform small-scale test processing (e.g., small patterns/text) on the sample.

Fix device properties like focus and wavelength, then test with medium-low power and medium speed baseline parameters.

Observe test results: If cutting is incomplete/engraving is too shallow, gradually increase power or decrease speed; if burning/rough edges occur, gradually decrease power or increase speed. Fine-tune repeatedly until achieving satisfactory results.

### 2. Safety Testing (Verifying Material Safety Risks)

During test processing, closely smell the processing area. If pungent, sour, or bitter odors appear, or if abnormal smoke (yellow-green, thick black) emerges, immediately stop processing and classify the material as "unknown harmful composition material," prohibiting further use.

Observe material thermal reactions during testing: If localized fires, material cracking, or slag splattering occur, immediately stop processing to avoid fire risks.

For metal materials, check for unusual noise or overheating in the laser after testing. These indicate excessive material reflectivity, requiring pretreatment before retesting.

### 3. Parameter Recording (Standardized Archiving, Facilitating Future Reuse)

After achieving satisfactory test results, accurately record the complete processing parameter set, including power, speed, pulse frequency, focus, and air assistance status.

Name parameters by material type + thickness + surface treatment and save them to the device software's "custom parameter library."

Also record material pretreatment methods and hardware adaptation accessories to form a standardized processing archive. When processing the same batch of materials later, simply call up the parameters without repeated debugging.

## 🚨 VII. Safety Warnings and General User Recommendations

Core laser processing safety risks relate to materials, environment, and operating habits. Beginners must remember these safety warnings and general recommendations to prevent safety accidents from the source while extending equipment lifespan.

### ⚠️ Core Safety Warnings

- Strictly prohibit processing the four prohibited material categories in Part II, even for "small-scale testing." Toxic gas and equipment damage risks are irreversible.
- Never leave laser processing unattended, especially when cutting flammable thin materials like paper and leather. Monitor the process throughout to prevent sudden fires.
- Never perform laser processing in enclosed spaces. Toxic smoke and dust accumulate in enclosed spaces, causing inhalation harm.
- Always wear specialized laser safety goggles when operating laser equipment. Even low-power lasers can burn retinas and damage vision through direct or scattered light.

### 💡 General User Recommendations

#### 1. Ventilation: Proper Smoke Extraction + Dust Protection

**Basic configuration**: Install a desktop smoke exhaust fan near the equipment to direct processing smoke and dust outdoors, avoiding indoor diffusion.

**Advanced configuration**: Add smoke exhaust pipes + filter cotton to filter smoke before排放, reducing environmental pollution while preventing dust from entering equipment internals and clogging rails or laser heads.

**Special materials**: Wear dust masks when processing dusty materials like gypsum and resin to avoid inhaling dust.

#### 2. Fire Prevention: Proper Fire Preparation, Eliminating Fire Hazards

- Keep flammables (paper, alcohol, foam, fabric) away from the equipment. Maintain a clear processing area with sufficient safety distance.
- Keep a dry powder fire extinguisher (suitable for solid/liquid fires) nearby. Never use water-based extinguishers (laser equipment is electrical, and water causes short circuits).
- When processing flammable thin materials (paper, non-woven fabric), use low power and high speed to reduce laser dwell time on material surfaces, avoiding heat accumulation and fire.

#### 3. Materials: Careful Material Selection, Proper Tracing and Storage

- Only purchase processing materials with clear composition labeling from reputable brands and channels. Reject unbranded, unlabeled materials.
- Material storage: Store processing materials in dry, ventilated environments to avoid wood molding and plastic aging. Separate processing materials from prohibited materials to prevent accidental use.
- Material reuse: If test samples show no safety risks, retain them as "material samples" for comparison when purchasing new materials, verifying material consistency.

#### 4. Equipment: Regular Maintenance, Reducing Equipment Failure Risks

- Clean slag and dust from laser heads and workbenches after processing to prevent slag from adhering to laser head lenses and affecting laser emission.
- Regularly lubricate equipment rails to prevent dust-induced wear and maintain processing precision.
- Avoid prolonged continuous processing. Allow the equipment to cool periodically to prevent laser overheating and damage, extending equipment lifespan.
