# Complete Guide to CNC Tool Selection

For beginners just starting with CNC, choosing the right tool can be confusing. There are various shapes, sizes, and materials of tools on the market - they all look similar, but actually each has its own purpose! This article will explain CNC tool knowledge in the simplest language, turning you from a "tool novice" to a "tool expert"!

## 🤔 Why is Tool Selection So Important?

Imagine this: what would happen if you tried to cut hair with a kitchen knife, or cut vegetables with scissors? It would definitely be slow, ineffective, and might even damage the tool!

Similarly, **choosing the right CNC tool** directly affects:
- ✅ Processing speed: A good tool helps you complete your work faster
- ✅ Processing quality: Smoother surfaces, clearer details
- ✅ Tool lifespan: Using the right tool makes it last longer
- ✅ Material cost: Reduce waste, lower costs

Therefore, understanding basic tool knowledge and learning to choose the right tool is a necessary skill for CNC beginners!

## 📏 Basic Tool Parameters

Before selecting a tool, we need to understand what those "numbers and symbols" on the tool mean. These parameters are like the tool's "ID card", telling us what it can do and how to use it.

### 1. 📏 Diameter

**Simply put: The thickness of the tool**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/直径.jpg" alt="Tool Diameter Diagram" style="width: 20%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Diameter is the most basic parameter of a tool, usually expressed in **millimeters (mm)**.

- For example: A 3mm tool is thinner than a 6mm tool and can carve more detailed patterns
- For example: A 6mm tool is thicker than a 3mm tool and is suitable for quickly cutting large materials

**Beginner Tip:**
- Use small diameter tools (1-3mm) for fine patterns
- Use large diameter tools (6-12mm) for cutting large materials

### 2. ✂️ Cutting Diameter

**Simply put: The diameter of the part that actually "cuts things"**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/切削直径.jpg" alt="Cutting Diameter Diagram" style="width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Some tools have different diameters for the shank and cutting part, so we need to look at the cutting diameter.

For example: Some tools have a 6mm shank but only a 3mm cutting part, so their cutting diameter is 3mm.

**Why is it important?**
- Cutting diameter determines how wide the tool can cut and how fine it can carve
- When selecting cutting diameter, consider the material thickness and processing detail requirements

### 3. 📐 Overall Length

**Simply put: The tool's "height", total length from the tip to the end of the shank**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/总长.jpg" alt="Tool Overall Length Diagram" style="width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Overall length is usually expressed in **millimeters (mm)**, generally between 50-100mm.

**Why is it important?**
- Overall length must be suitable for your CNC machine's tool holder length
- Too long tools are prone to "vibration", affecting processing precision
- Too short tools may not reach the material to be processed

### 4. 📏 Flute Length

**Simply put: The length of the part with "spiral grooves" on the tool**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/刃长.jpg" alt="Tool Flute Length Diagram" style="width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Flute length determines how deep the tool can cut.

- For example: A tool with 10mm flute length can cut up to 10mm deep
- For example: A tool with 20mm flute length can cut up to 20mm deep

**Beginner Tip:**
- Flute length should be slightly longer than the depth you need to cut
- For example: To cut 8mm deep material, a tool with 10mm flute length is sufficient

### 5. 🔪 Number of Flutes

**Simply put: How many "cutting edges" the tool has**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/刃数.jpg" alt="Tools with Different Number of Flutes" style="width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Common flute counts include: 1-flute, 2-flute, 3-flute, 4-flute, etc.

- **2-flute tools**: Most commonly used! Suitable for carving soft materials like wood and plastic
- **3-flute/4-flute tools**: Suitable for processing hard materials like metal, with smoother surfaces
- **1-flute tools**: Suitable for cutting materials like acrylic, with cleaner cut edges

**Beginner Tip:**
- Use 2-flute tools for soft materials (wood, plastic)
- Use 3-4-flute tools for hard materials (metal, aluminum alloy)

### 6. 🔺 Angle Parameters

There are several important angle parameters on tools, which sound complex but are actually easy to understand:

#### 🔺 Helix Angle

**Simply put: The tilt angle of the spiral grooves on the cutting edge**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/螺旋角.jpg" alt="Helix Angle Diagram" style="width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

- Small helix angle (0-20°): Suitable for processing hard materials, more durable
- Large helix angle (30-60°): Suitable for processing soft materials, smoother cutting

#### 🔺 Rake Angle

**Simply put: The "sharpness" of the cutting edge**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/前角.jpg" alt="Rake Angle Diagram" style="width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

- Positive rake angle: Sharper cutting edge, suitable for soft materials
- Negative rake angle: More robust cutting edge, suitable for hard materials

#### 🔺 Clearance Angle

**Simply put: The tilt angle behind the cutting edge**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/后角.jpg" alt="Clearance Angle Diagram" style="width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

The role of clearance angle is to reduce friction between the tool and material, making cutting smoother.

### 7. 🛡️ Shank Diameter

**Simply put: The diameter of the part where the tool is inserted into the machine**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/柄径.jpg" alt="Tool Shank Diameter Diagram" style="width: 30%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Common shank diameters include: 3mm, 6mm, 8mm, 12mm, etc.

**Why is it important?**
- Shank diameter must match your CNC machine's tool holder
- For example: If your machine can only hold 6mm tool holders, you cannot use tools with 8mm shank diameter

**Beginner Tip:**
- Most desktop CNC machines use 6mm shank diameter tools

### 8. 🎯 Corner Radius

**Simply put: The fillet size at the tool tip**

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/tool-selection/刀尖半径.jpg" alt="Corner Radius Diagram" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

- Sharp tip (radius 0): Suitable for carving fine lines
- Rounded tip (radius > 0): Suitable for cutting flat surfaces, smoother surfaces

**Beginner Tip:**
- Use sharp tips for carving text and patterns
- Use rounded tips for cutting flat surfaces and large areas
