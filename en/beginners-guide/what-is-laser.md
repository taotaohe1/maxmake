### 2. Core Principles

⚡ **How Laser Equipment Works**

Simply put, the core of laser equipment is to create a beam of extremely powerful, highly directional intense light (laser), then focus this beam into an extremely small spot, and use the high energy of the spot to process materials.

#### Specific Working Process:

1. **Laser Generation**: The equipment applies electricity/energy to an internal "special medium" (such as optical fiber, gas), causing this medium to emit intense light with completely consistent frequency and direction—this is laser

2. **Conduction and Focusing**: Through mirrors, focusing lenses and other accessories, the laser is conducted to the material surface and focused into an extremely small spot

3. **Energy Concentration**: The energy of this spot becomes highly concentrated, and when it irradiates the material, it can quickly melt, vaporize the material, or even directly burn a gap

4. **Path Control**: The equipment controls this spot to move on the material surface according to a preset path, completing operations such as cutting, engraving, and marking

### 2. Integrated Camera

📷 **Specific Approach**: Install a high-definition industrial camera next to the laser head, connecting the camera to the equipment's control system

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/what-is-laser/集成摄像头.png" alt="Integrated Camera" style="width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

**Practical Uses**: The camera can automatically "see" where the workpiece to be processed is and what the workpiece's outline looks like. No need for operators to manually adjust workpiece position or manually align the tool— the equipment will automatically align the processing path with the workpiece position, saving time and avoiding manual positioning errors for more precise processing.

### 3. Intelligent Heat Dissipation

🌡️ **Specific Approach**: Add temperature and flow sensors to the cooling system to automatically sense the temperature of the equipment's core components

**Practical Uses**: When temperature is high, it will automatically increase cooling capacity (such as water chiller accelerating water output, increasing flow); when temperature is low, it will automatically reduce cooling capacity. No need for manual adjustment—this prevents core components from being burned due to insufficient heat dissipation, avoids wasting electrical energy, and can automatically alarm and shut down when cooling system malfunctions (such as water cutoff).

### 4. Convenient Structure

🎛️ **Specific Approach**: Optimize the equipment's mechanical structure, commonly including liftable worktables, quick-change fixtures, movable equipment bodies, and foldable protective covers

**Practical Uses**: Liftable worktables can adapt to workpieces of different thicknesses; quick-change fixtures can quickly replace workpieces to be processed; movable bodies can be flexibly placed according to processing sites. Overall, this makes clamping and operation more convenient, adapting to the processing of workpieces of different sizes and thicknesses.

## 📊 5. Key Parameter Analysis of Laser Equipment

These three parameters determine what materials the equipment can process, how precise the processing can be, and how thick the materials can be processed—they are the key to selecting equipment and adjusting processing parameters.

### 1. Wavelength

🌈 **What is Wavelength?**

It can be simply understood as the "unique characteristic" of laser. Lasers generated by different laser media have fixed wavelengths that cannot be随意 adjusted.

| Item | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Unit** | Nanometers (nm), microns (μm), 1μm=1000nm |
| **Actual Impact** | Determines whether materials can "absorb" laser energy—only lasers that materials can absorb can be used for processing |

#### Core Correspondence:

### 2. Spot Diameter

🎯 **What is Spot Diameter?**

The "spot size" of the laser on the material surface after being focused by the optical system. The smaller the spot, the more concentrated the energy. The size can be adjusted by replacing different focusing lenses.

| Item | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Unit** | Microns (μm, almost invisible to the naked eye, for example, a strand of hair is about 60μm in diameter) |
| **Actual Impact** | Determines processing precision and efficiency |

#### Core Correspondence:

| Spot Size | Energy Characteristics | Suitable Scenarios | Typical Applications |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Small spot (≤50μm) | Highly concentrated energy, ultra-high processing precision | Fine work | Engraving small characters on metal jewelry, cutting narrow gaps in thin metal plates |
| Large spot (≥100μm) | More uniform energy distribution, faster processing speed | Rough processing/large area processing | Large area engraving on wood panels, cutting thick steel plates |

<img src="/eng/beginners-guide/media/what-is-laser/光斑直径对比2.png" alt="Spot Diameter Comparison" style="width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

### 3. Peak Power

⚡ **What is Peak Power?**

The maximum laser energy that laser equipment can output in a short time, not the power of the equipment during continuous operation—equivalent to the laser's "maximum strength that can be exerted instantly," which can be adjusted through the control system.

| Item | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Unit** | Watts (W), kilowatts (kW) |
| **Actual Impact** | Determines the laser's penetration ability and processing depth |

#### Core Correspondence:

| Peak Power | Penetration Ability | Suitable Scenarios | Typical Applications |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| High peak power | Strong penetration ability, can quickly melt thick, hard materials | Thick material/heavy-duty processing | Cutting thick steel plates, deep wood engraving, welding large metal parts |
| Low peak power | Weak penetration ability, shallow processing depth | Shallow processing | Shallow marking, fine processing of thin materials, such as printing logos on plastic parts, cutting thin aluminum plates below 0.5mm |

> ⚠️ **Important Note**:
> Peak power is not the higher the better—it should be adjusted according to the thickness and hardness of the processed material. Too high power will burn and deform the material processing surface, affecting processing quality.
