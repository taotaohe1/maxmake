# What is CNC?

For beginners who know nothing about CNC, this might sound like a professional and complex term. But actually, CNC isn't that mysterious! This article will explain what CNC is, its origins, and its various types in the simplest language.

## 🤔 What Exactly is CNC?

CNC stands for **Computer Numerical Control**, simply put, it's **a technology that uses computers to control machines**.

Imagine this:
- If you want to carve a pattern on a piece of wood, the traditional method is to use hand tools (like a carving knife) to slowly carve it
- With CNC, the method is: first draw the pattern on a computer, then let the computer control the machine to automatically complete the carving

In other words, CNC makes machines "smart" - they can work automatically according to computer programs without manual operation throughout the process.

## 🏭 The Origin of CNC

The development of CNC technology dates back to the mid-20th century:

- **1940s**: During World War II, the U.S. Air Force needed to manufacture high-precision aircraft parts, and traditional manual methods couldn't meet the demand
- **1952**: The first CNC milling machine was born, developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Parsons Corporation
- **1960s**: The development of computer technology made CNC more practical and began to be widely used in industry
- **1980s**: The popularity of personal computers made CNC equipment smaller and cheaper
- **21st century**: Desktop CNC equipment appeared, and ordinary people could use CNC technology for creation

## 📚 Types of CNC

CNC technology can be applied to many different types of machines. Here are the most common ones:

### 3D Printers
