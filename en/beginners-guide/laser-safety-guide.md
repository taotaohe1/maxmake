# Laser Safety Guide

This document provides detailed safety precautions for laser processing, helping beginners systematically understand laser radiation safety, smoke and harmful gas management, fire prevention and response, mechanical and electrical safety, as well as standardized operating procedures. It ensures laser processing is conducted safely and standardized, avoiding safety accidents.

## 📋 I. Laser Radiation Safety

Laser radiation is the most representative safety risk of laser equipment. Even desktop low-power lasers have beam energy sufficient to burn human tissue (especially the eyes), and laser reflected light also has radiation harm. Core protection revolves around enclosed optical paths, reflection avoidance, and personal protection—all three are indispensable.

### 1. Enclosed Optical Path Design

Desktop laser engravers are equipped with original optical path protective covers/enclosed chambers, which are the first barrier for radiation protection. During operation, strictly follow: Keep the protective cover/chamber closed throughout processing, only open briefly when placing materials or adjusting equipment. Never disassemble or open optical path protective components while the laser is emitting. Beginners should not modify the equipment's optical path to avoid damaging the original enclosed design and causing laser beams to be exposed. If the equipment's protective cover is damaged or loose, immediately stop using it and repair it before operating to prevent unobstructed laser beam scattering.

### 2. Reflection Protection

When laser beams irradiate high-reflective material surfaces, they produce strong reflected light with the same energy as the original beam, which can easily burn human tissue and damage equipment core components. This is a key challenge in laser radiation protection: During processing, prohibit placing high-reflective items such as metal accessories or mirror materials near the optical path area. Preferentially lay black non-metallic anti-slip mats on the workbench (to reduce reflectivity). When processing reflective materials (such as mirrored acrylic or polished metal), prepare materials in advance and ensure no metal components contact the processing area throughout. Avoid direct laser beam irradiation on smooth surfaces like walls or mirrors to prevent secondary reflection. If the processing space is small, stick anti-laser reflection tape on surrounding walls.

### 3. Personal Protective Equipment

Wearing dedicated personal protective equipment is the last barrier for laser radiation protection. Never replace professional laser protective equipment with ordinary protective gear. Essential protective equipment and usage requirements for desktop laser processing:

- **Laser Safety Glasses**: Must choose dedicated safety glasses matching the equipment's laser wavelength. This is the core protective equipment, worn throughout equipment operation. Never replace with ordinary sunglasses or tinted glasses. Regularly inspect safety glasses and immediately replace them if scratches or damage occur.
- **Protective Gloves**: Choose high-temperature resistant, scratch-resistant, flame-retardant protective gloves. Wear them when placing materials and cleaning the workbench to prevent burns from laser high temperatures and scratches from processing waste or equipment components.
- **Auxiliary Protection**: When processing materials that generate a lot of dust or smoke, wear a protective face shield to prevent laser scattered light from irradiating the face and block dust from entering the eyes. Long-haired operators should tie up their hair to avoid it approaching optical paths and moving parts.

## 🌫️ II. Smoke and Harmful Gas Management

The essence of laser processing is to achieve material vaporization and decomposition through high temperatures, which produces processing dust, smoke, and harmful gases from thermal decomposition of some materials. Inhaling these substances can irritate the respiratory tract, damage internal organs, and cause chronic diseases with long-term exposure. The core management principles are source control, continuous exhaust, and environmental monitoring.

### 1. Ventilation System Setup

Ventilation is the core measure for smoke and harmful gas management. Never conduct laser processing in enclosed spaces. Low-cost, easy-to-setup ventilation solutions suitable for desktop equipment are all achievable by beginners: Basic ventilation can be achieved by installing a desktop exhaust fan next to the equipment, directing the exhaust port at the processing area to directly exhaust smoke and dust outdoors, avoiding indoor diffusion. Advanced protection can include exhaust pipes and filter cotton to preliminarily filter smoke before emission, reducing outdoor environmental pollution and preventing dust from entering the equipment and causing component damage. When processing materials with high dust production such as gypsum or resin, a small industrial vacuum cleaner can be used alongside ventilation to real-time adsorb processing-generated dust.

### 2. Material Toxicity Control

Controlling the use of toxic materials from the source is the fundamental way to reduce harmful gas production. Strictly follow material processing specifications: Only process compliant materials with clear ingredient labeling. Strictly avoid prohibited processing materials such as chlorine-containing plastics, heavy metal-containing materials, and halogen-containing materials. Do not attempt to process unbranded materials with unknown ingredients. For newly encountered materials, first conduct small-scale sample processing, closely observe smoke color and smell during the process. If yellow-green or black dense smoke appears, or if there are pungent, sour, or bitter odors, immediately stop processing, determine it as a toxicity-releasing material, and prohibit continued use. When processing materials that easily generate dust, in addition to ventilation, wear dust masks to prevent dust from being inhaled into the respiratory tract.

### 3. Environmental Monitoring

Desktop civilian processing scenarios do not require professional gas detection equipment. Sensory monitoring + simple auxiliary monitoring can meet safety needs, while also properly handling the environment after processing: Continuously observe smoke and odor changes during processing, immediately stop the machine and increase ventilation if abnormalities occur. In spaces where laser processing is conducted for a long time, place simple air quality detectors to real-time monitor indoor dust and harmful gas concentrations. When concentrations exceed standards, immediately stop processing and open windows for ventilation until indicators return to normal. After processing, do not immediately turn off ventilation equipment. Continue ventilation for several minutes to exhaust residual smoke and harmful gases in the space before performing subsequent cleaning work.

## 🔥 III. Fire Prevention and Response

The high temperatures of laser processing produce slag and open flames, and some processing materials (paper, leather, foam) are flammable. Fire is the most likely safety accident in laser processing. The core of protection is source fire control, flame retardant protection, and emergency fire extinguishing equipment, while mastering correct fire response methods.

### 1. Fire Source Control

Reducing the possibility of open flames and slag causing fires from an operational perspective is the key to fire prevention: When processing flammable materials such as paper, thin leather, and non-woven fabric, avoid using high-power, low-speed processing parameters to reduce laser dwell time at single points on materials, preventing heat accumulation from igniting materials. Never leave laser processing unattended, even for short periods—pause the equipment if leaving. Observe processing status throughout to promptly detect small flames, slag splatter, and other hazards. Prohibit stacking flammable materials within 30cm of the equipment workbench and its surroundings, such as paper, alcohol, foam, cloth, curtains, etc. Keep the processing area clear to avoid slag falling and igniting surrounding items.

### 2. Flame Retardant Design

Through simple flame retardant protective measures, reduce the probability of fire occurrence. Even if slag or small flames are produced, effectively prevent fire spread: Lay high-temperature resistant, flame-retardant protective mats on the workbench, such as metal plates or fire-resistant asbestos mats, to avoid slag directly falling on wooden workbenches and causing combustion. When processing materials that easily produce slag (such as acrylic or thin metal), place a slag collection tray under the material to timely collect slag and prevent it from falling to the ground and igniting debris. The laser processing space should be away from flammable and explosive item storage areas, and avoid operating equipment in areas with flammable decorations such as curtains or carpets.

### 3. Fire Extinguishing Preparation and Emergency Response

Prepare appropriate fire extinguishing equipment in advance and master correct usage methods—this is the core of responding to sudden fires. Never use incorrect fire extinguishing methods for laser equipment fires: The equipment must be equipped with dry powder fire extinguishers (suitable for electrical fires and solid material fires) nearby. Never use water-based fire extinguishers, as laser equipment is electrical equipment, and using water can cause equipment short circuits and may even lead to electric shock accidents. Also equip fire blankets for covering small flames to isolate oxygen and extinguish fires, suitable for handling initial small fires on processing materials or workbenches. If small flames appear during processing, immediately press the equipment's emergency stop button and cover the fire source with a fire blanket. If the fire expands, immediately evacuate the scene and call the fire department—never attempt to extinguish it yourself. Smoldering fires caused by slag are not easy to detect. After processing, inspect materials, workbenches, and surrounding areas to confirm no smoldering hazards before leaving.

## ⚙️ IV. Mechanical and Electrical Safety

Desktop laser engravers contain high-speed moving parts and electrical control systems. Improper operation can easily cause mechanical collisions, pinching, electric shocks, and other safety accidents. The core of this risk protection is isolating moving parts, standardizing electrical use, and familiarizing with emergency response mechanisms—adapting to basic protection requirements for civilian equipment.

### 1. Moving Parts Protection

Laser heads and workbenches are the core moving parts of the equipment, operating at relatively fast speeds and easily causing mechanical injuries. During operation, strictly follow: During equipment operation, never insert hands, fingers, or any body part into the processing area, and never touch the high-speed moving laser head and workbench by hand. Never place foreign objects such as screws, tools, or water cups on the workbench to prevent foreign objects from being caught by moving parts, causing equipment jamming, damage, or ejection injuries. Protect the area around the equipment to prevent children from approaching or touching it. If there are onlookers, maintain a safe distance and prohibit onlookers from touching equipment operation buttons. When replacing or adjusting equipment accessories (such as focusing lenses or fixtures), first turn off the equipment power and wait for moving parts to completely stop before operating.

### 2. Electrical Safety

Electrical system failures can easily cause electric shocks, equipment short circuits, and fires. Standardize equipment electricity usage and daily inspections, prohibit makeshift wiring: The equipment must be connected to a proper grounded power supply to ensure good grounding, avoiding equipment leakage causing electric shocks. Never connect the equipment to ungrounded power strips. Use original supporting power cords and adapters, never replace them with electrical accessories from other equipment. Do not makeshift wiring or share a power strip with high-power appliances (such as air conditioners or induction cookers) to prevent voltage instability from damaging the equipment. Before processing, check if power cords, plugs, and sockets are damaged, aged, or loose. If any of these conditions occur, immediately stop using and replace them before operating. Never place liquids (such as water or beverages) on or around the equipment to prevent liquid from spilling into the equipment and causing electrical component short circuits or burnout.

### 3. Emergency Response Mechanism

Familiarize yourself with the equipment's emergency operation components in advance and establish standardized emergency response procedures to quickly and correctly handle sudden situations: Remember the location of the equipment's emergency stop button, which is a prominent red button usually located on the front of the equipment body or on the operation panel. In any emergency situation (such as fire, abnormal noise, personal injury, or equipment jamming), press the emergency stop button first to cut off laser emission and equipment movement. If the equipment has electrical faults such as abnormal noise, smoke, or strange odors, first press the emergency stop button, then turn off the equipment's main power switch. Never continue operation or attempt to disassemble and repair the equipment yourself—contact official after-sales service for inspection and handling. If an electric shock accident occurs, immediately cut off the on-site power supply before providing first aid to the injured—never touch the injured person without disconnecting the power.

## 📝 V. Standardized Operating Procedures

Most safety risks in laser processing stem from non-standard operating habits. Establishing standardized operating procedures for pre-processing, during processing, and post-processing is the key to fundamentally avoiding safety accidents. The following procedures are suitable for all civilian processing scenarios of desktop laser engravers and must be strictly followed by beginners.

### 1. Pre-Processing Preparation

- **Environmental Check**: Confirm the processing space has good ventilation, no flammable materials or obstacles in the processing area, and good power grounding.
- **Equipment Check**: Inspect all equipment components (laser head, guide rails, protective cover, emergency stop button) for integrity, no damage to power cords or plugs, and smooth movement of the laser head and workbench without jamming.
- **Material Check**: Confirm processing materials are compliant and processable, with no unknown or toxic components. For new materials, prepare samples first.
- **Protection Preparation**: Wear laser safety glasses, protective gloves, and other dedicated personal protective equipment. Set up ventilation, slag collection, and other protective measures.
- **Material Fixation**: Standardly fix materials on the workbench, confirm they are securely fixed and flat, with no high-reflection accessories near the processing area.

### 2. During Processing Operation

- **Equipment Debugging**: Debug XY axis positions and processing paths with the laser emission turned off. Confirm no offset or obstruction, avoiding laser beams directly irradiating equipment components or high-reflection surfaces.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: After starting processing, stay by the equipment throughout, never leave without authorization. Real-time observe processing status, including laser emission, material processing conditions, smoke odor, and equipment operating sounds.
- **Standard Operation**: During processing, never open the optical path protective cover, arbitrarily adjust processing parameters, touch moving parts, or add/change materials on the workbench.
- **Hazard Handling**: If any abnormalities are found (fire, unusual smoke, abnormal sounds, material offset), immediately press the emergency stop button, stop processing, and restart only after handling the hazard. Never operate with faults.

### 3. Post-Processing Conclusion

- **Equipment Shutdown**: After processing is complete, first stop laser emission, then set the equipment to standby mode. Wait for the laser head and workbench to completely stop before turning off the equipment's main power switch.
- **Continuous Ventilation**: Continue operating ventilation equipment for several minutes to exhaust residual smoke, harmful gases, and dust in the processing area.
- **Site Cleaning**: Wear protective gloves to clean processing waste, slag, and dust from the workbench. Timely clean slag from slag collection trays. Never directly touch high-temperature slag or waste by hand.
- **Equipment Inspection**: Check if equipment components have slag or dust adhesion, and if the laser head and protective cover are intact. After confirming no equipment abnormalities, organize protective equipment and processing materials.
- **Environmental Inspection**: Check the processing area and its surroundings to confirm no open flames, smoldering, or residual slag fire hazards. Turn off ventilation equipment and lighting, and organize the operating area.
