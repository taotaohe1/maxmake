# 🤔 How to Choose CNC Processing Materials? Essential Guide for Beginners

For CNC beginners, choosing the right processing material may be more important than adjusting parameters! Choosing the right material makes processing twice as effective with half the effort; choosing the wrong material may directly lead to tool damage and part scrapping. This article will explain in the most easy-to-understand language how to choose and process different materials, turning you from a "material novice" to a "material master"!

## 🛠️ Materials That Can Be Processed by Milling Machines

### Why introduce materials that can be processed by milling machines?

Because our **D1/D1S is a milling machine**! Milling machines are one of the most commonly used and versatile equipment in CNC processing. They cut fixed workpieces through rotating tools and can process parts of various complex shapes. Understanding the materials that milling machines can process directly relates to the processing effect and success rate of your D1/D1S use.

Milling machines have strong "cutting ability" and can process most common materials, but **hard materials require special tools, while soft materials can be cut casually**. Let's divide them into 4 categories, each explaining "what it is + what it's used for" so you can understand at a glance:

### 🏭 Metal Materials
**Advantages**: High strength, good durability, strong thermal and electrical conductivity, suitable for structural parts and functional components.
**Disadvantages**: Some metals (such as steel, high-temperature alloys) are difficult to process, require special tools, and have high costs.

**Light Alloy Materials**: Mainly aluminum and magnesium alloys, characterized by being light, soft, and particularly easy to cut, the "entry-level metal" for milling machine processing

## 🧪 Test on "Easy-to-Process Materials" Before Processing: Save Money + Improve Success Rate

This is a **general operating technique** for CNC processing, which beginners must remember. The core is one thing: **don't start cutting expensive, hard, rare materials right away, first practice with cheap easy-to-process materials**

### Why test first?

**Save cost**: Easy-to-process materials (such as aluminum blocks, plastic boards, pine wood) are very cheap, even if you cut them wastefully or damage them while testing parameters, you won't feel bad; if you directly cut stainless steel, carbon fiber, gold and silver, the loss will be great if you cut them wastefully.

**Increase success rate**: The core of processing is adjusting parameters such as **speed, feed, cutting depth**; different materials have different parameters; first test on easy-to-process materials to adjust the parameters smoothly (such as cutting smoothly, smooth surface, no tool chipping), then use the same parameters to cut target materials, which can avoid cutting target materials wastefully and also avoid damaging tools.

### A simple example that beginners can understand:

If you want to process stainless steel parts (hard, expensive), first take an aluminum block (soft, cheap), test cutting on the milling machine by adjusting parameters such as speed, tool travel speed, and penetration depth, until the cut aluminum block has a smooth surface and the tool is fine, then apply these parameters to cut stainless steel, the success rate will be greatly improved.

## ⚠️ Core Points to Note for Processing Different Materials

Different materials have different "temperaments", and the points to note when cutting are different. The core is to remember to **"follow the material's temperament"** to avoid cutting waste materials and damaging tools. Let's talk about them by category, only focusing on the most critical points, beginners just remember the key points:

### 🏭 Metal Processing (Core 3 points: Cooling + Suitable Tools + Use End Mills)

All metal processing should pay attention to these 3 points, hard metals (steel, stainless steel) should focus on doing them, soft metals (aluminum, copper) can do them appropriately:
- **Must cool**: Metal cutting will generate **high-speed friction heat**, the temperature is particularly high, not cooling will burn the tool dull and chipped, and also deform metal parts; the cooling method is very simple, just **spray coolant** on the tool and material when cutting (like watering to cool down a hot object).
- **Choose suitable tools**: Soft metals (aluminum, copper) can use ordinary tools, hard metals (steel, stainless steel, high-temperature alloys) must use **special coated tools** (such as the TiAlN coating mentioned before, high temperature resistant, wear resistant), don't use ordinary tools to cut hard, it will directly break the tool.
- **Try to use end mills**: Cut more "smoothly" than ordinary straight knives, tools are less stressed, not easy to break, and the cut metal surface is smoother, beginners can make fewer mistakes with end mills.

### 🪵 Wood Processing (Core 1 point: Dust collection, plus 2 small notes)

Wood processing is low difficulty, the key is to solve the **wood chip problem**, other notes are simple:
- **Better to collect dust**: Wood cutting will produce a lot of wood chips, if not sucked away, the wood chips will stick to the tool, making the tool unable to cut, blocking the line of sight, and even being inhaled into the nose which is uncomfortable; just use a **dust collector** to suck away the wood chips, keep it on during processing.
- **Small note 1**: Don't cut too fast, easy to chip the wood edges;
- **Small note 2**: Tools should be sharp, blunt knives will burn the wood, making the surface black.

### 🧩 Non-Metal Processing (Plastic / Ceramic / Stone / Glass, plus key notes)

- **Engineering Plastics**: Don't cut too fast, too high speed will make plastic **melt and stick to the tool**, the cut edges will be burnt, just cut slower.

- **Ceramic / Stone / Glass**: All are **hard and brittle** materials, the core is "slow cutting + shallow cutting", don't penetrate too deep or walk too fast at once, otherwise it will directly crack and break, especially glass, super easy to break, beginners should try to process less glass.

### 🎯 Composite Material Processing (Carbon Fiber / Glass Fiber, Core 1 point)

This type of material is most afraid of **delamination and cracking**, such as carbon fiber boards, cutting too fast will separate the surface layer from the inner layer, the core is "slow cutting + using sharp tools", don't use blunt knives, blunt knives will grind the material into layers.

### 💎 Special Material Processing (Cemented Carbide / Gold and Silver, plus key notes)

- **Cemented Carbide (Tungsten Carbide)**: Ultra-hard, must use **special ultra-hard tools**, slow cutting + cooling, beginners don't easily process.

- **Gold, Silver, Platinum Soft Metals**: Cut "lightly" during cutting, don't have too high speed or too fast feed, avoid scratching and deforming soft metals, after all, they are precious metals, scratching will devalue them.

## 📝 Final 3 General Notes: Processing Adaptability + Process Selection + Material Properties

These are the **core principles** for material selection and processing. No matter what material beginners process, first think about these 3 points, which can avoid 90% of mistakes, explained in plain language throughout, no need to remember professional terms:

### 1. First look at processing adaptability: Materials should match your milling machine and tools

Simply put, it's **"do what you can"**. If your milling machine is an ordinary entry-level model and the tools are also ordinary, don't process hard materials (such as stainless steel, cemented carbide, ceramics), which will probably not cut and damage the equipment; entry-level milling machine + ordinary tools, start with soft materials (aluminum, plastic, wood), then process hard materials after changing to high-end milling machines and special tools.

### 2. Then choose the appropriate process: Determine processing steps based on materials

Different materials use different processing methods, the core is **"fast cutting for soft materials, slow cutting for hard materials, shallow cutting for brittle materials"**:

- **Soft materials (aluminum, plastic, wood)**: Can cut faster, penetrate deeper at once, high efficiency;
- **Hard materials (steel, stainless steel, cemented carbide)**: Must cut in multiple shallow layers, cut slowly, don't be greedy for speed;
- **Brittle materials (ceramics, stone, glass, carbon fiber)**: Shallow cutting + slow cutting to avoid cracking and delamination.

### 3. Finally understand material properties: First understand the material's "temperament", then adjust parameters

Before processing, simply understand the basic characteristics of the material: **soft or hard, brittle or tough, afraid of heat or scratch**, then adjust parameters according to the characteristics, such as:

- **Heat-sensitive materials (metals, plastics)**: Cool during cutting + don't cut too fast;
- **Chipping-prone materials (ceramics, stone)**: Slow cutting + shallow cutting;
- **Scratch-prone materials (gold and silver, acrylic)**: Use sharp tools + light cutting.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q1: What materials should beginners choose to practice with at first?
**A**: Strongly recommend starting with **aluminum, plastic, wood** these three materials:
- **Aluminum**: Soft, easy to cut, moderate price, the best entry-level material for metal processing
- **Plastic**: Lowest cost, minimum processing difficulty, suitable for practicing parameter adjustment
- **Wood**: Cheap, easy to obtain, low noise during processing, suitable for familiarizing with milling machine operations

### Q2: What to do if materials always chip at the edges during processing?
**A**: Causes and solutions for edge chipping:
- **Brittle materials (ceramics, stone, glass)**: Slow cutting + shallow cutting, use sharp tools
- **Wood**: Slow down feed rate, use sharp tools, can stick tape on edges before processing
- **Acrylic**: Use sharp single-flute tools, slow cutting, keep cooling
- **Metal**: Reduce cutting depth, use end mills, ensure tools are sharp

## 🎯 Summary

### Must-see for beginners: Choosing the right material is half the battle for processing success!

If you're using the D1/D1S milling machine for the first time, don't worry, you'll understand everything after reading this part!

### What materials to use for practice at the beginning?
- **Recommended materials**: Aluminum, plastic, wood
  - Aluminum: Soft, particularly easy to cut, not expensive
  - Plastic: Cheapest, don't feel bad if cut bad, suitable for practice
  - Wood: Can be found everywhere, low noise when cutting, beginner-friendly
- **Don't challenge hard bones at first**: Hard things like stainless steel, carbon fiber, wait until you're skilled before touching them, otherwise it's easy to damage tools and machines

### What to note during processing?
- **Cutting metal**: Slow down speed, reduce feed speed, choose the right tools (special tools for hard metals)
- **Cutting wood**: Better use vacuum cleaner to suck wood chips, slow down feed speed
- **Cutting plastic**: Slow down speed and feed speed, keep tools sharp

### Practical tips
- **First practice with cheap materials**: For example, if you want to cut stainless steel, first try how to adjust the machine with aluminum blocks, then cut expensive materials after adjustment
- **Work according to material temperament**: Soft materials can be cut faster (adjust faster feed speed), hard materials need to be cut slowly (adjust slower speed and feed speed), brittle materials need to be cut lightly (adjust smaller cutting depth, slow down feed speed)
  - **Soft materials**: Such as aluminum, plastic, wood, these materials are soft and easy to cut
  - **Hard materials**: Such as stainless steel, steel, these materials are hard and need to be cut slowly
  - **Brittle materials**: Such as ceramics, stone, glass, these materials are particularly brittle and easy to break when touched
- **Protect your machine**: Don't use the entry-level D1/D1S to cut particularly hard things, the machine will be exhausted

### Final words
Using the D1/D1S milling machine is like learning to ride a bicycle, take it slowly and start practicing with simple materials. First master aluminum, plastic, wood these materials, then try difficult ones. Remember, the key to processing success is not how powerful the machine is, but whether you understand the material's temperament and know how to get along with them. Try a few more times, summarize more experience, and you will become a processing master sooner or later!
