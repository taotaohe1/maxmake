## ⚠️ Important Safety Notice

> **We strongly recommend using MaxmakeLab software for processing control**
>
> **Reasons**: Our MaxmakeLab software is specifically developed for our equipment, with safety optimizations for various operating scenarios, such as:
>
> - When encountering tool change commands like T*M6, it automatically stops sending subsequent codes to ensure the safety of tool change operations (avoiding issues like spindle not stopping that may occur with other software)
> - Optimized for the equipment's motion characteristics to ensure smoothness and precision during processing
> - Built-in safety protection mechanisms to effectively prevent equipment damage caused by abnormal operations
> - Fully compatible with equipment hardware, avoiding various abnormal behaviors caused by software incompatibility
>
> **Using other control software may lead to unknown abnormal behaviors, and could even cause equipment damage or personal injury. For your safety and the normal operation of the equipment, we recommend always using MaxmakeLab software for processing control.**
